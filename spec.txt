1. Goal:
I need to write a tool to compare the data in three excel files.

The first excel file contains the data to be checked. For example "_Import CheckList-SIM1058324 New._CheckList_Data_17.43.45.xlsx"
It has the following columns:
P/N, Desc, HSN, Duty, Welfare, IGST, Cus AIDC, Hlth Cess, PCS, Edu Cess, Sec Higher Edu Cess, Cus Edu Cess, Cus Sec Higher Edu Cess, GST Cess, Qty, Price, Category, Item#, TxtLine, Cus Notn, Value Amt

The second excel file contains the partial data to be checked against. For example "24HC01713海运物料 - 副本.xlsx". This is the BOM data from the shipping slip.
It has the following columns:
"Item Nos.", "Model No.", "P/N", "Description", "Original Country", "Quantity PCS", "Unit Price USD", "Amount USD", "Alternative materials"
								
The third excel file contains the other partial data to be checked against. For example "税率汇总-20230822.xlsx"
It has the following columns:
"Item name", "India HS code", "BCD", "SWS", "IGST", "BCD", "SWS", "IGST", "BCD", "Remark"

2. The checking logic:
a) The P/N in the first excel file should be found in the second excel file's P/N column.
b) The Desc in the first excel file should be found in the second excel file's Description column.
c) The HSN in the first excel file should be found in the third excel file's India HS code column.  
d) The Duty in the first excel file should be found in the third excel file's BCD column.

3. Runtime environment:
- Python
- Pandas
- Openpyxl
- Xlsxwriter

4. This code needs to be run on both Windows and Mac. Also, it would be good if it can be run in a web browser.
